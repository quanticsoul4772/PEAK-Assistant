Hypothesis Evaluator – Evaluates threat hunting hypotheses using 8 criteria.
- Inputs: positional text files (one hypothesis per line)
- Outputs (default: current directory):
  * console summary with score distributions
  * JSON with comparison results
  * optional full JSON with all hypothesis details
  * log file capturing console output
- Models: Configured via model_config.json (supports Azure, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

Usage:
  hypothesis-eval file1.txt [file2.txt ...] -c model_config.json
  [--output results.json] [--log eval.log] [--json-output full.json] [--no-json]
  [--raw] [-q]
